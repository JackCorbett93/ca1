For this project the task was to create a website that will take in data from an API. This data is about CSGO ESports and will be sorted into cards by using ReactStrap which will display each part of the information neatly. These cards will be sorted alphabetically to make it easier to find the teams. There will also be a search function that allows the user to more easily find the exact team they are looking for.
To run this program open it up in node console and install npm and reactstrap. After this just run npm start
